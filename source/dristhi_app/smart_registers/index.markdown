### Service Modes

There are two categories of Service modes in FP Register. First category includes all the ECs who use FP method (called 'FP Methods') and is further divided based on the FP methods (example Condom, OCP, etc). Second category includes all ECs who do not use any FP method (called 'FP Prioritization') and is further divided into High Priority ECs, ECs having more than two children and ECs having one child.  
This way of grouping helps ANM in providing appropriate FP advice/service for the client, for example, all ECs using OCP FP method need to be given fresh stock of OC Pills regularly and all the ECs who have more than two children and are not using any FP method need to be strongly adviced to use a FP Method, etc.
